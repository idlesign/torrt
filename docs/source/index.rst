Description
-----------

*Automates torrent updates for you.*

**torrt** automatically checks your favourite torrent tracker sites, where torrents
are organized as articles (i.e forum-like tracker), to verify whether specific torrents have been updated
(e.g. torrent bundling some TV-series is updated with a new episode), and instructs your torrent client
to download new files.

Automatic updates are available for:

* AniDUB - http://tr.anidub.com/
* AniLibria - https://www.anilibria.tv/
* CasStudio - https://casstudio.tv
* Kinozal - http://kinozal.tv/
* NNM-Club - http://nnm-club.me/
* RUTOR - http://rutor.org/
* RuTracker (ex torrents.ru) - http://rutracker.org/

**torrt** is able to cooperate with the following torrent clients:

* Transmission (using built-in JSON RPC)
* Deluge (using `deluge-webapi` plugin - https://github.com/idlesign/deluge-webapi)
* uTorrent (using built-in RPC)
* qBittorrent (using built-in RPC)

**torrt** is able to send notifications about downloaded files with:

* Mail (using SMTP server)
* Telegram (using telegram bot API) - https://core.telegram.org/bots/api


**torrt** can function both as a console application and Python module.

**torrt** can be managed through Telegram messenger. You can add new download in a few messages.
